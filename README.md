# Boston Crimes Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on exploring and analyzing crime data in Boston. The goal of this project is to gain insights into crime patterns, trends, and correlations in order to aid law enforcement and inform public safety measures.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Boston Crimes dataset, which provides information about various criminal incidents reported in the city of Boston. The dataset includes details such as the type of crime, location, date, time, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found in the `data` directory.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data`: This directory contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the step-by-step analysis process.
- `reports`: This directory contains the final reports and visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `src`: This directory contains any source code or scripts used in the project.

## Analysis Process

The project follows a systematic analysis process, which includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies. Features are transformed or engineered as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various statistical and visual techniques are applied to explore the dataset. This includes analyzing crime trends over time, identifying high-crime areas, examining crime categories, and detecting any patterns or correlations.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods are used to derive meaningful insights from the data. This may involve hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or other techniques to understand relationships between variables and their impact on crime rates.

4. **Data Visualization**: The project includes the creation of informative visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps to present the findings in a clear and understandable manner.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis results, conclusions are drawn, and recommendations are provided for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and other relevant stakeholders.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including but not limited to:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium

To ensure the project runs smoothly, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. The specific versions of the libraries used can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/shanmuondigital/boston-crimes-analysis.git
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the analysis process and reproduce the results.

5. Refer to the generated reports in the `reports` directory for the final analysis findings.
